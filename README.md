This infographic displays data showing where percentage of students are from. The data was published in Fall 2022, and includes four categories: PA, NY/NJ, Other States, and International. The key findings show that the highest percentage of students are from NY or NJ and the lowest percentage of students are international students.

This data shows the relationship between whether people smoke and their income. Regarding background information, this graph appeared on April 10, 2020 in a New York Times article that showed the change overtime in the distribution of U.S. income, education, health, family structure and employment. The method of gathering this data included showing the percentage of each income category that responded to a survey with either smoking “every day “or “some days.” The subgroups are in ascending order and show four household income categories. The overall key finding was that if the household income bracket is greater, the percentage who smoke “every day” or “some days" is less. The implications of the data highlight that there is an inverse relationship between smokiing and the amount of income.

Textual description explaining the background: This is a data frame with 1000 observations of 6 variables which are (sex) Gender of the student, (sat_v) Verbal SAT percentile, (sat_m) Math SAT percentile, (sat_sum) Total of verbal and math SAT percentiles, (hs_gpa) High school grade point average (fy_gpa) First year (college) grade point average. I only took data from a few columns displaying (sat_sum) Total of verbal and math SAT percentiles, (hs_gpa) High school grade point average. 

Main findings & Implications: Students with a higher total of verbal and math SAT percentiles tend to have a higher high school grade point average. However, the data is still mixed.

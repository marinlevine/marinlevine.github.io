This infographic displays data showing where percentage of students are from. The data was published in Fall 2022, and includes four categories: PA, NY/NJ, Other States, and International. The key findings show that the highest percentage of students are from NY or NJ and the lowest percentage of students are international students. 

## Smoking & Income Data 
![Smoking & Income](https://github.com/marinlevine/marinlevine.github.io/blob/main/Smoking%20&%20Income.png?raw=tru)

This data shows the relationship between whether people smoke and their income. Regarding background information, this graph appeared on April 10, 2020 in a New York Times article that showed the change overtime in the distribution of U.S. income, education, health, family structure and employment. The method of gathering this data included showing the percentage of each income category that responded to a survey with either smoking “every day “or “some days.” The subgroups are in ascending order and show four household income categories. The overall key finding was that if the household income bracket is greater, the percentage who smoke “every day” or “some days" is less. The implications of the data highlight that there is an inverse relationship between smokiing and the amount of income.

## Apple Product Timeline

This timeline represents the evolution of Apple products overtime. It also discusses the achievements and fallbacks that owner Steve Jobs experiences throughout his job at Apple. The reason I decided to choose this timeline is because Apple has evolved so much in so litle time. Additonally, the reason I have decided to stop this timeline at the year 2017 instead of more current is because the information that I focused on only had product descriptions for that time, and I am not very familiar with the present day models that Apple is coming out with. This timeline does do a decent job of showing how advanced Apple has become compared to when the company first began.

## Top 10 Fast Food Restaurants Worldwide by Value in 2019
![ChartBuilder](https://github.com/marinlevine/marinlevine.github.io/blob/main/_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)
This chart is my homework for the "Bar/Column Chart assignment." This chart displays the top 10 fast food restaurants worldwide by value in 2019. It is not surprising to see that Mcdonalds is the top of the list. $130 Million is a very large amount of money and it drastically differs from the rest of the restaurants. I was very surprised to see that Taco Bell was at the bottom of the list though since it is very popular. 

## % of students in Lehigh undergraduate colleges over the past ten years

## SAT and GPA data for 1000 students at an unnamed college
![ChartBuilder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marinlevine/marinlevine.github.io/380ff458e2804e3598bcc0cb788f043b02de76a3/SAT_and_GPA_data_for_1000_students_at_an_unnamed_college_High_school_grade_point_average._chartbuilder.svg)

Textual description explaining the background: This is a data frame with 1000 observations of 6 variables which are (sex) Gender of the student, (sat_v) Verbal SAT percentile, (sat_m) Math SAT percentile, (sat_sum) Total of verbal and math SAT percentiles, (hs_gpa) High school grade point average (fy_gpa) First year (college) grade point average. I only took data from a few columns displaying (sat_sum) Total of verbal and math SAT percentiles, (hs_gpa) High school grade point average. I took the data from the first 17 students. 

Main findings & Implications: Students with a higher total of verbal and math SAT percentiles tend to have a higher high school grade point average. However, the data
is still mixed.

## Top 10 Best Food Cities in the World

This map shows the Top 10 best food cities in the world. Although I live in the United States, I thought it would be fun to research worldwide. After researching, I found that at the top of the list for best food was San Sebastian, Spain and the lowest was Seoul, Korea. The data was pretty scattered, since the culture of food is so different. From examining this data, I found that European countries are a hotspot for food, especially Italy.

The 2013 data is from Data.gov and it shows many different concepts relating to universities such as county name, the types of degrees offered, estimated enrollment, ACT percentile score, etc. The first map I chose to create with the given data was universities admissions total & associate degrees offered. The second map was universities full time enrollment & geographic region.

This infographic displays data showing where percentage of students are from. The data was published in Fall 2022, and includes four categories: PA, NY/NJ, Other States, and International. The key findings show that the highest percentage of students are from NY or NJ and the lowest percentage of students are international students.

This data shows the relationship between whether people smoke and their income. This graph appeared on April 10, 2020 in a New York Times article that showed the change over time in the distribution of U.S. income, health, education, employment and family structure. The data shows the percentage of each income category that responded to a survey with either smoking “every day “or “some days.” The subgroups are in ascending order and show four household income categories. If the household income bracket is greater, the percentage who smoke “every day” or “some days" is less, which displays an inverse relationship among the data.
